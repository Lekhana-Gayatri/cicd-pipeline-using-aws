In this project a django application is deployed to aws ec2 via a codepipeline service in aws. First when a change is triggered in this repository's main brach  then the pipeline gets started to execute. Firstly it will get the source code from github upto the lastest commit and then by using code build serice a docker image is build and pushed to dockerhub then after build phase the code deploy will triggered to deploy the application in ec2 instance by pulling the image from docker hub and running a container in ec2 finally the changes made in the source code will be applied to the application. To deploy the application in ec2 we need to install codedeploy- agent in ec2 first. And also we need to attach the IAM role to ec2 for communication between code deploy and ec2 instance.
